# Decentralized Cross-Industry Knowledge Management Platform

A blockchain-based solution for secure, transparent, and value-driven sharing of knowledge assets across organizational boundaries.

## Overview

This platform leverages blockchain technology to create a trusted ecosystem where organizations from different industries can securely register, share, access, and monetize knowledge assets. By establishing a decentralized framework for knowledge management, the system encourages cross-industry collaboration, accelerates innovation, reduces duplication of efforts, and creates new value streams from existing intellectual capital.

The system consists of five core smart contracts that work together to ensure secure, fair, and efficient knowledge exchange:

1. **Entity Verification Contract**: Validates and authenticates participating organizations
2. **Knowledge Asset Registration Contract**: Records and catalogs available information assets
3. **Access Control Contract**: Manages permissions and rules for knowledge sharing
4. **Usage Tracking Contract**: Monitors and records knowledge utilization
5. **Value Exchange Contract**: Handles compensation and incentives for knowledge access

## Key Features

- **Trusted Participant Network**: Verified organizations with established digital identities
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Registry**: Searchable catalog of available knowledge assets
- **Granular Access Controls**: Flexible permission systems for different sharing models
- **Transparent Usage Tracking**: Clear visibility into how knowledge assets are utilized
- **Automated Value Exchange**: Programmable compensation for knowledge contributions
- **Cross-Industry Discovery**: Breaking silos between traditionally separate sectors
- **Verifiable Provenance**: Clear tracking of knowledge origins and evolution
- **Privacy Preservation**: Sharing value while protecting sensitive information

## Contract Details

### Entity Verification Contract

Responsible for validating and authenticating organizations participating in the knowledge network.

- Verifies organizational identity through multi-factor authentication
- Manages reputation scores based on platform participation
- Stores organizational metadata (industry, size, expertise domains)
- Handles membership lifecycle (application, approval, suspension)
- Implements governance mechanisms for network participation
- Enables specialized industry groups and consortiums

### Knowledge Asset Registration Contract

Records and catalogs knowledge assets available for sharing on the platform.

- Registers knowledge assets with metadata and classification
- Creates unique digital identifiers for each knowledge asset
- Manages knowledge versions and revision history
- Implements knowledge taxonomy and ontology frameworks
- Supports various knowledge formats (documents, data, models, etc.)
- Provides search and discovery mechanisms

### Access Control Contract

Manages permissions and rules for knowledge sharing across organizations.

- Defines granular access permissions for knowledge assets
- Implements conditional access rules based on criteria
- Manages time-limited and usage-limited access grants
- Supports confidentiality levels and clearance requirements
- Handles access requests and approval workflows
- Enables dynamic access policy updates

### Usage Tracking Contract

Monitors and records how knowledge assets are accessed and utilized.

- Tracks access events with comprehensive metadata
- Records knowledge application and derived works
- Implements citation and attribution mechanisms
- Generates usage analytics and impact metrics
- Ensures compliance with usage terms and conditions
- Supports knowledge impact assessment

### Value Exchange Contract

Handles compensation and incentives for knowledge contribution and access.

- Manages tokenized value exchange for knowledge assets
- Implements various pricing models (subscription, pay-per-use, etc.)
- Handles royalty distribution for collaborative knowledge
- Supports non-monetary value exchange (barter, reciprocal access)
- Provides escrow services for knowledge transactions
- Enables programmatic value distribution based on usage
